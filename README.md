# CFPB Jekyll-It

Static sites are all the rage these days. This starter kit gives all you need to get one going on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Github install using a ```gh-pages``` branch.

## To start

1. You can [learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
2. Read up on [how Github Pages work](http://pages.github.com/).
3. You can try to run Jekyll locally, but you don't have to. To install it, follow the [instructions in the Developer Handbook](https://github.cfpb.gov/pages/cfpb/handbook/edit-me.html). Otherwise, you can simply push your site to your ```gh-pages``` branch, and bam â€“ instant site.

## Next

Let's do this. Via the Terminal:

    mkdir my-new-blog; cd my-new-blog
    git clone git://github.cfpb.gov/davidakennedy/cfpb-jekyll-it.git

### What This Does 

All this kit does is set you up with the typical Jekyll directory structure, a sample index.html file, a sample post, a shared header and footer, and a set of default configurations. That's it -- no fanciness.

To create a new post, just:

    touch _posts/yyyy-mm-dd-url-friendly-title.md

... where yyyy-mm-dd is a date (e.g., 2012-08-31) and url-friendly-title is, well, a URL-friendly title.  Then inside that post, be sure to add at least the minimal [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) (see the _posts folder for an example):

    ---
    layout: post
    title: A test post
    ---

    This is a test.

## Important Notes

* Includes a sample about page and test post for you to get started with.
* The main menu and site title can be changed by editing the ```header.html``` file in the ```_includes``` directory.
* Comes with a basic one-column layout/design based on [Staticly](https://github.cfpb.gov/davidakennedy/staticly).
* Has a basic ```_config.yml``` file to control your site settings. Be sure to change your ```baseurl``` setting to the URL of your Github pages branch.

CFPB Jekyll-It is great for internal blogs, a note-taking repo or project documentation.

Static, ftw.
